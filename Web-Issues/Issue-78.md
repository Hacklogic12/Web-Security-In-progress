## Open Redirection
***
1. **Description**
```
- Open redirection vulnerabilities arise when an application incorporates user-controllable data into the target of a redirection in an unsafe way. An attacker can construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain. This behavior can be leveraged to facilitate phishing attacks against users of the application. 
- Open Redirect is a vulnerability in which the attacker manipulates a web page to redirect the users to unknown destinations (malicious/phishing destinations in most of cases).
